Project name : Lottery Simulator\n
Description :

Lottery announces winners once a week. 
There is no limit to the number of entries, so one person can participate multiple times in a single round. 
The numbers to choose from are from 1 to 45. 
The organizers draw 6 'regular winning numbers' and 1 'bonus number' every week. 
Participants choose 6 different numbers each time they participate. 

The prize amount is determined according to the following rules:

Match all 6 of my chosen numbers with the 6 regular winning numbers: 1 billion won.
Match 5 of my chosen numbers with the 5 regular winning numbers, and match 1 of my numbers with the bonus number: 50 million won.
Match 5 of my chosen numbers with the 5 regular winning numbers: 1 million won.
Match 4 of my chosen numbers with the 4 regular winning numbers: 50000 won.
Match 3 of my chosen numbers with the 3 regular winning numbers: 5000 won.
